DETECTING CUPS
-----------

In our project the visual input is taken from a birds-eye view.  Thus to detect cups simple circle detection is done (with appropriate radii).  If the camera input is not vertical then a projective transform will need to be done before circle detection.  Example code of this has also been provided.  The files to do with this part of the code are:

__function1__ Does some sweet stuff!

__function2__ Doesn't really do anything...
